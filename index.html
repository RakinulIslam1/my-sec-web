            <p>I'd like to add some verse from Qu'ran Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala said: Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it
                had
                been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it
                much contradiction. Qur'an [4:82]</p>
                <p>And it was not [possible] for this Qur'an to be produced by other than Allah, but [it is] a confirmation of what was
                before it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the
                worlds. Qu'ran [10:37]

            <h1>BE PATIENT & POSITIVE</h1>
            <h2 class="color">The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)</h2>
            <p>“Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient,
            Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a
            blessing better and greater than patience” (Bukhari).</p>
            <p>This world is a prison for the believer, but a paradise for the disbeliever (Sahih Muslim).</p>
