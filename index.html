            <p>I'd like to add some verses from Qu'ran.<br> Allah subhanahu wa'ta'ala said: Then do they not reflect upon the Qur'an? If it
                had
                been from [any] other than Allah, they would have found within it
                much contradiction. Qur'an [4:82]</p>
                <p>And it was not [possible] for this Qur'an to be produced by other than Allah, but [it is] a confirmation of what was
                before it and a detailed explanation of the [former] Scripture, about which there is no doubt, from the Lord of the
                worlds. Qu'ran [10:37]</p>
                <p>O believers! Be mindful of Allah and let every soul look to what deeds it has sent forth for tomorrow. And fear Allah, for certainly Allah is All-Aware of what you do. Qur'an [59:18]</p>

            <h1>BE PATIENT & POSITIVE</h1>
            <h2 class="color">The words of the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him)</h2>
            <p>“Whoever abstains from asking others, Allah will make him contented, and whoever tries to make himself self-sufficient,
            Allah will make him self-sufficient. And whoever remains patient, Allah will make him patient. Nobody can be given a
            blessing better and greater than patience” (Bukhari).</p>
            <p>This world is a prison for the believer, but a paradise for the disbeliever (Sahih Muslim).</p>

            <h1>THINK POSITIVE ABOUT ALLAH</h1>
            <p>“Allah the Most High said, ‘I am as My servant thinks (expects) I am. I am with him when he mentions Me. If he
                mentions
                Me to himself, I mention him to Myself; and if he mentions Me in an assembly, I mention him in an assembly greater
                than
                it. If he draws near to Me a hand’s length, I draw near to him an arm’s length. And if he comes to Me walking, I go
                to
                him at speed’” (Hadith Qudsi).</p>

            <h1>TAWBAH MAKES A WAY OUT</h1>
            <p>“Whoever does a lot of Istighfar (asking for forgiveness), Allah will provide him a way out of each concern he has, and
            will solve all his troubles, and will provide him with livelihood from sources that were not known to him” (Ahmad).</p>
